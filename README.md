# TSP
TSP C#

Visual Studio project. 
Console based program which takes a TSP problem as an input (for example Berlin52, included in the folder) and returns the shortest way found using genetic algorithm.
This project lacks >real< interface and the parameters (input file, % for mutation etc.) are to be set by editing the code in Program.cs
